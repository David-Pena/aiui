Now you can use any of these commands from the root:

pnpm dev:core - Run core development server
pnpm dev:docs - Run docs development server
pnpm storybook - Run Storybook
pnpm test - Run tests
pnpm build - Build all packages

Make sure for any feature you create for the package/core, add the stories and tests.
